"sh sm <ret>" will make all the libraries and demo code
"sh sln <ret>" will build links into the /usr/lib directory. (YOU MUST UDATE DIRECTORY PATH MANUALLY IN SCRIPT)
"sh sr <ret>" will run the demo code

Build procedures for liblgdst and libaccess
 	1. No more IPC requirement on either Tx or Rx host library implementation
	2. make clean; make lgdst_t(r)x access_ctl_t(r)x access_vid_t(r)x; at Tx/Rx transport folder respectively
	3. since we'll have to run usb lower level codes in preliviged mode, create file links in /usr/lib
		 cd /usr/lib;
		 sudo ln -s ${TX/RX-transport folder}/liblgdst_t(r)x.so.1.0 ./liblgdst_t(r)x.so
		 sudo ln -s ${TX/RX-transport folder}/libaccess_ctl_t(r)x.so.1.0 ./libaccess_ctl_t(r)x.so
		 sudo ln -s ${TX/RX-transport folder}/libaccess_vid_t(r)x.so.1.0 ./libaccess_vid_t(r)x.so

Build procedures for sample Tx/Rx codes using -llgdst_t(r)x and -laccess_ctl_t(r)x, -laccess_vid_t(r)x
	1. there are two kinds of sample codes which demostrate how to bring usb (tx/rx) core up for routine operation
		 and how to bring usb (tx/rx) core up for traditional 'lgdst' command line utility, now are unified inside
		 one executable
	2. make Makefile demo_t(rx) to build sample program for either Tx/Rx
	3. to enable routine operation, such like
		 	sudo ./demo_tx  0 127.0.0.1 5559								# run routine control and video radio links, all ips and ports are not used
		 	sudo ./demo_rx 0 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 5561			# any more but keep as being compatible with original interface
		 at the same command prompt, try to issue lgdst command such like
		 	lgdstc 0 tx ctune 0x40 or lgdstv 0 tx atten 0x3000
		 	lgdstv 0 rx pair-id 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 or lgdstv 0 rx vscan
		 cmd lgdstc and lgdstv are used to indicate which type of lgdst library, control or video, to pass into

TX access library usage (all numbers are in hex radix)
	lgdst 0 tx Vn														gives current NIOS HW/FW version
	lgdst 0 tx Vf															gives current FPGA HW version
	lgdst 0 tx Va															gives current Atmel FW version
	lgdst 0 tx Uf file												upgrade FPGA HW with given bin file
